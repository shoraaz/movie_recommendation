# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A personalized movie recommendation system leveraging collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences. ([movie-recommendation/ReadME.md at master - GitHub](https://github.com/demirkeseny/movie-recommendation/blob/master/ReadME.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 🚀 Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies by finding similar user preferences.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data and normalizes ratings for accurate predictions.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step analysis and visualization. ([Movie-Recommendation-System/README.md at master - GitHub](https://github.com/Gurupradeep/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/master/README.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shoraaz/movie_recommendation.git
   cd movie_recommendation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

## 📈 Usage

Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence to:

1. Explore and preprocess the dataset.
2. Build and train the recommendation model.
3. Evaluate and visualize the model's performance. ([Movie-Recommendation-System/main.py at master - GitHub](https://github.com/shinyZu/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/master/main.py?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
